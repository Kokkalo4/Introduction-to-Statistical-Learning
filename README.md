# Introduction-to-Statistical-Learning
About 2 months ago i followed the 15-hour course In-depth introduction to machine learning in 15 hours of expert videos that I found advertised on this blog: https://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/

Each chapter has some theory videos and also some R lab videos. On this repository i have uploaded all R lab notes as were shown on the videos. 
NOTE: I have put on and written more things than the original video shows.
